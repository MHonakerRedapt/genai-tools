Remind them they don’t have to like or love vegetables, but our bodies still need them. To avoid waste, offer new foods in small amounts and wait at least a week before trying again. Build “food bridges.” Once your child accepts a food, introduce another one that is similar (for instance, mashed sweet potatoes can become a bridge to mashed carrots) . As long as your child has energy and is growing, they’re probably eating enough. Stick to set meal and snack times and keep those times pleasant and mediafree. Encourage your child to pay attention to their body and when it is full, and trust what they tell you. Don’t force them to clean their plate. Keep offering healthy choices: “Would you like broccoli or carrots for dinner?” Involve kids in choosing and preparing food. Figure out the healthy foods they really like (for instance, clementines are small, delicious, and fun to peel) . Look for fruits, vegetables, and salads. Skip the cheese and go lighter on mayonnaise and sweetened sauces like ketchup or barbecue sauce. Be aware of large portions (children need less than adults), and share the meal or bring a container to save it for later. Look for healthy desserts such as sliced fruit.

He just wants to be playing and in control and engaged in the world in a way that you can't really do when you're just laying flat on your back with your pants off. He's now able to try and twist himself off the table. So I strap him in and make sure that everything is set up before the actual diaper changing happens. For us, there needs to be a toy right there. And sometimes even the toy doesn't work, and I will sing a song, literally, holding on to dance, literally singing and sometimes dancing to distract him. Like most things with parenting, set it up beforehand so then when we get to the situation, the wipes are there, the diapers are there, the toy is there. So we can make it go as quickly as possible. [whistling] [giggling] Oh, what is this? Oh, a puppy. It has gotten more difficult now that he actually is playing, like really gets into something. Or if he's playing a game with his sisters, he doesn't want to leave his sisters to go and get his diaper changed. Now that he's much stronger and he can kick, it's become even more difficult. And sometimes we'll do it where he is. It's that much easier to bring the diaper and the wipes there. We enlist his help, and he holds the diaper for us. Diaper. Good. We play a little game of peekaboo. He'll pull out wipes for us, sometimes too many, but that's OK. We can put them back in. That's enough. You know it's time to start potty training. When kids will go in a corner and need privacy, he's not there yet. I mean, he might need a diaper change now. Yeah. [laughter] [kissing] Great job.

So encourage parents to stay and have them, you know, volunteer. And then, you know, I call it the container. We were talking about it. Again, being from a Hispanic background, you don't go to anyone's house without bringing something. And you don't leave, you know, a Hispanic home without taking something. 'Cause they're gonna give you something some way, somehow. They're gonna just say like, here, take this or whatever. So I love that. It's the mentality of that container. So when you and the families drop off, it doesn't have to be every time, but it can be certainly, you know, once a month or whenever you feel it's the right time, bring something to the provider, whether it be, you know, a candle or fragrance or a flower, you know, something that you know that that provider is really gonna like. Something that the provider may have complimented you on that you said, oh, I wanna pick this up for her because she liked it. So bring the container and then provider, make sure that the family's leaving with a container. And so I say, you know, put a really cute game in it. Or I would say, give some words of advice on, you know, I know you're going into potty training soon. So here's something that I think might help you. And write that and give it to the parents. So it can be literally a container or it could be figuratively a container. But the idea is that you have that reciprocity and share with each other your gratitude and your celebration for one another. Because if that provider's not doing a great job, that child is not thriving. And if that family is not doing a great job, that child is not thriving.

       "     'content': '. Use timers. Visual timers, such as those used in the kitchen, can help children understand how long they have to wait before getting what they want (such as daddy taking a break to play). For example, the timer can be set for 10 minutes while your child plays independently with blocks (he or she may check the timer now and then to see how much time is left). The amount of time you set will depend on your child’s age and abilities; it’s usually best to start with shorter times and build slowly to longer times. Use visual schedules. You can make a poster that shows the order of specific activities for the day, or for part of the day. Use small cards on which you have written and/or drawn a simple word and icon for each activity. Arrange the cards from left to right to indicate the sequence of activities. For instance, 1. play with toys, 2. put toys away, 3. say hi to mom while she takes a work break, 4. watch a video, 5. play a game with brother, 6. lunchtime. With practice, many children will learn to move through the schedule independently, knowing that there will be times that they can visit you when you’re working. Post a sign on the door of the room you’re working in (or on the wall wherever you’re working) that looks like a stoplight to show when you’re free. Use a Velcro (or sticky clay) to attach a cutpaper arrow to the sign to indicate: Green: Come in! Yellow: Please knock first. Red: I’m busy, please wait. Use other visual and physical reminders. These cues let children know where a certain activity should take place. For example, you can designate a specific area of the room as a “play space” by using bookshelves to define the space. You might also use a rug or mat or put down masking tape to show the boundaries. This strategy can encourage selfcontrol. Emphasize routines. A predictable order of events can lower children’s anxiety and help them build independence. Some examples of consistent routines are washing our hands before meals, walking the dog after breakfast, and reading bedtime stories before going to sleep. Offer rewards. Children can earn stars, stickers, or other special treats for following their schedule',\n",

Here are ideas for answering common questions: Will everything be different now? With the drastic shifts that divorce or separation can cause, it might feel like everything will change. But reminding your child of the simple everyday routines and activities that will stay the same can provide a sense of security. You might begin: “I know a lot of things have been changing, but lots of our routines will stay the same. You will always get dressed after you wake up in the morning, then eat breakfast, brush your teeth, and do your special helping job.” Who’s going to take care of me? With changes in routines and living arrangements, kids might begin to worry that everyone will be too busy to pay attention to and take care of them. Let them know the plan for the new routines and reassure them that no matter where they are, someone will always be there to help them. You might begin: “Mommy and Daddy might not live together anymore, but we will always be your mommy and daddy. No matter what, that will never change, and we will both always take care of you.” What should I tell my friends and other kids at school about the divorce? Many young children are eager to share their home life with their friends at school. If your child wants to explain his family situation to his friends, you can help him decide what to say. You can begin: “I bet your friends would love to know about your family. You can let them know, ‘My parents are divorced. That means they aren’t married anymore, but I still have a mom and a dad and they care about me\n",

While having these conversations, sit together in a comfortable place and hold kids close. While you talk, hold their hand or give them a long hug. A simple touch can go a long way. Here are ideas for answering three common questions: What’s a divorce? This big question can come at any time—sometimes when you least expect it. You might say, “A divorce is when two people decide not to be married anymore. Although we won’t be married anymore, we will always be your mom and dad.” Why did you get a divorce? You might have many answers to this question, but the best thing to remember is that there are certain things to share and other things that don’t need to be shared. You can say, “Mommy and Daddy had grownup problems that we couldn’t fix, even though we tried and tried. Even though we won’t be married anymore, we’ll always love you. Our divorce is not your fault.” Will you get back together? This may be an uncomfortable question. Still, it’s an important one to clarify. If the answer to this question is “no,” communicate this. Answer honestly, but without sharing unnecessary details about why. You might say, “No, we are not going to get back together, but we will always be your mommy and daddy.” Related Tags: For Parents and Caregivers Articles Related Resources Coparenting Conversations Simple conversation starters to develop your parenting partnership.

      "Managing Changes  Sesame Workshop Article Managing Changes Divorce Toddler (1–3) Preschooler (3–5) Kindergartener (5–6) Use these tips to help a child dealing with divorce to feel secure in daily routines. en Español How to Talk to Kids about Tough Topics Divorce Managing Changes During changes and transitions, it’s more important than ever to remind children that there are some things—like daily routines and loving relationships—that will stay the same. Routines Keeping up simple activities and routines will provide children with a sense of security and stability in their everyday lives. Take photos of children doing an everyday routine that will stay the same, such as a bedtime routine. Then make a slideshow on your phone to look at together each night. This will remind children of the things they can expect to happen each day—no matter where they are. Try saying: “I know some things have been changing, but lots of routines will stay the same. Every night, you’ll eat dinner and then get ready for bed. You’ll brush your teeth, change into your pajamas, and read a book before lights go out.” Care  With changes in routines and living arrangements, children might begin to worry that everyone will be too busy to take care of them. Reassure them that no matter where they are, someone will always be there to support them. Let kids know who they can expect to drop them off at school, pick them up from a play date, or put them to bed. Find opportunities to remind them that there are so many people, in addition to their parents, who love them and will take care of them. Try saying: “Mommy and Daddy might not live together anymore, but we will always be your mommy and daddy. No matter what, that will never change, and we will always take care of you.” Related Tags: For Parents and Caregivers Articles Parenting & Family Programs Related Resources Coparenting Conversations Simple conversation starters to develop your parenting partnership.

      ". You can let them know, ‘My parents are divorced. That means they aren’t married anymore, but I still have a mom and a dad and they care about me.’” Adapt your words to fit your situation. For instance, if your child goes back and forth between two homes, you can suggest that he say, “I have two houses. Sometimes I stay with my mom at her house and sometimes I stay with my dad at his house.” He might describe some of the fun things he does at each house. Give kids some time to come up with their own answers.
